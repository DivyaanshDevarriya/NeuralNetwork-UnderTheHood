# NeuralNetwork-UnderTheHood
A work under process, this project aims to create Neural Networks and perform all the activities related to them without the use of any high-level library like Pytorch or Tensorflow. My aim is to learn all the stuff underneath the magic of Neural Networks.
I was insipired to do it after taking a Deep Learning Specialization course from Coursera and I'm still doing that course. By doing this, I hope to gain a deep insight in the working of Nural Networks.
